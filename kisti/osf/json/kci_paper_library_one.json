It is possible to associate course management system and library resources, and to provide course-specific information rather than library interface with various searching gateways. In the case of foreign university libraries, library course pages have been developed more effectively and variously for university's environment and characteristics, and have been built for all the courses in a university by system processing, not manually. In foreign libraries, there are many sophisticated, dynamic, database-driven house-developed and vendor- developed systems for library course pages than hand coded HTML pages. But in Korea, there is a lack of awareness of the importance of library course pages among librarians, and the programs of library course pages have not yet been developed. Therefore, this study is to build the model for library course pages using literature reviews and case studies. Then, this study could also lay the foundation for effective library services and the system development of library course pages.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201003", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "27", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc11c\uc740\uacbd", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001507712", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:46:29", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079949", "LASTPAGE": "32", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\u300e\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0\u300f \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ub3d9\ud5a5\ubd84\uc11d ", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "Trends Analysis on Research Articles in the Journal of Korean Society for Information Management", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "7", "LDT": "2017-07-26T10:07:04", "CN": "ART001507712", "ABSTRACT": "The aims of this study were to provide a global overview of research trends in information science and to trace its changes in the main research topics over time using trends analysis.

This assumption was verified to be correct by manually analyzing how the stock prices change after the relevant news stories were released. This means that we will be able to predict the stock price change to a certain degree if there is a reliable method to classify news stories as either favorable or unfavorable toward the company mentioned in the news.

Also, the concepts were limited to terms within AAT's Furniture Facet, and the system was tested using the Chair concept, which is a lower-level facet that has a diverse conceptual relationship and broad vocabulary base. The ontology system is capable of searching for concepts, while controlling the search results by always providing a 'Preferred term' for synonymous terms. In addition, the system provides the user with first, a relationship between the terms centered around the inquiry, and second, related terms along with their classification properties. Also, the system is presented as an application example of the ontology system that constructs a information system that intakes an Instance value and reproduces it into a RDF file.

Information extraction can be defined as a process of converting unstructured documents into formalized, tabular information, which consists of named-entity recognition, terminology extraction, coreference resolution and relation extraction. Since all the elementary technologies have been studied independently so far, it is not trivial to integrate all the necessary processes of information extraction due to the diversity of their input/output formation approaches and operating environments. As a result, it is difficult to handle scientific documents to extract both named-entities and technical terms at once. In order to extract these entities automatically from scientific documents at once, we developed a framework for scientific core entity extraction which embraces all the pivotal language processors, named-entity recognizer and terminology extractor.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201103", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "19", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uae40\uc11d\uc601", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001003307", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:48:55", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "US", "KCI_ID": "1080132", "LASTPAGE": "231", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ucc38\uace0\uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \uac1c\ubc1c\ub3d9\ud5a5", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "Recent Developments and Trends of Digital Reference Service", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "214", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART001003307", "ABSTRACT": "This paper describes recent developments and trends of digital reference services.

It remains unclear whether the factors of LibQUAL+TM have any effect on its adoption. A framework was adapted from Icek Ajzens theory of planned behavior and proposed to extract factors affecting the adoption of library services. The factors were examined via data collection from a Web-based questionnaire survey with college students in the United States. Factor analyses and multiple regression analysis were conducted. Findings show that the intention to use library services is explained by attitude toward library service quality. The attitudinal factors that are significant are (1) perceived personal control, (2) perceived affect of service, and (3) perceived comprehensiveness of information. The relative importance among the factors is also represented by the numbered sequence. However, perceived timeliness of information access and the perception of library as place do not have a significant effect on the intention.

Nine Korean homonyms are selected for the sense disambiguation and retrieval experiments. The total of approximately 120,000 news articles comprise the raw test collection and 18 queries including homonyms as query words are used for the retrieval experiments. A Naive Bayes classifier and EM algorithm representing supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms respectively are used for the disambiguation process. The Naive Bayes classifier achieved 92% disambiguation accuracy, while the clustering performance of the EM algorithm is 67% on the average. The retrieval effectiveness of the semantic vector space model incorporating the Naive Bayes classifier showed 39.6% precision achieving about 7.4% improvement. However, the retrieval effectiveness of the EM algorithm-based semantic retrieval is 3% lower than the baseline retrieval without disambiguation.

Because of the unique data characteristics, metadata in the statistical domain is essential not only for finding and discovering relevant data, but also for understanding and using the data found. However, in statistical metadata research, more emphasis has been put on the question of what metadata is necessary for processing the data and less on what metadata should be presented to users.In this study, a case study was conducted to gauge the status of metadata provision for statistical tables on the Internet.

A clustering technique is used to get dynamic user segmentations using user preference to contents categories. Then a sequential pattern mining technique is used to extract contents access patterns in the user segmentations. Finally, the recommendation is given by our recommendation algorithm using user contents preference history and contents access patterns of the segment.

Another finding was that there were clear differences in open access aspects by academic field. Medicine, pharmacy, natural science, agriculture, fisheries, oceanography, and engineering had stronger open access aspects than humanities, sociology, arts, physical education, and interdisciplinary science.

Supervised approaches employ machine learning techniques to automatically learn the author similarity function from author-resolved training samples.

Accordingly, the needs for searching opinions expressed in the Web are also increasing. However, it is difficult to meet these needs by using a classical information retrieval system that only concerns the relevance between the user's query and documents. Instead, a more advanced system that captures subjective information through documents is required.

Knowledge creation is essential to achieve competitive advantage in today\u2019s knowledge-oriented working environments. There has been huge investment on knowledge management systems to achieve such advantages. It is, however, widely recognized that distributed knowledge management systems often fail due to the different social contexts across the sub-organizations where the local information systems are deployed. It is important to coordinate such social gaps across the sub-organizations to achieve better advantages. Given that Weblogs users often feel a shared social norm, Weblogs play a positive role of narrowing the social gaps. This paper argues that the genre analysis of Weblogs could provide important clues to narrow the social gaps existed across the sub-organizations within an organization. Hence, such taxonomical practice may be a solution for the high rate of failure in knowledge management system implementations in an organization. This paper uses the theory of organizational knowledge creation (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) and social construction of technology (SCOT) approach (Bijker, 1995) to compare the socialized with the non-socialized integration of distributed information systems. The findings of this research provide a useful framework for better implementing knowledge management practices especially in distributed working environments.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200803", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "25", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uae40\uc120\ud638", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001235933", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:49:33", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080198", "LASTPAGE": "59", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uacf5\uacf5\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00\uc758 \u2018\ub3c5\uc11c\uc758 \ub2ec\u2019 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \uc720\ud615\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "The Analysis of the User Types on the Programs of the Public Libraries during the Month of Reading", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "43", "LDT": "2017-07-25T19:34:31", "CN": "ART001235933", "ABSTRACT": "This study investigated the main user types of the reading programs which are provided by sixty-two public libraries during September, \u201cthe Month of Reading,\u201d in seven metropolitan cities, Seoul, Pusan, Daegu, Incheon, Daejeon, Gwangju and Ulsan.

Through these different facets, a faceted framework was constructed to mediate semantic, syntactical, and structural differences across heterogeneous metadata standards.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201006", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "32", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc720\uc18c\uc601", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001974026", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:43:39", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079645", "LASTPAGE": "169", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc790\uc544 \uc911\uc2ec \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ub3d9\uc801 \uc778\uc6a9 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud1a0\ud53d\ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uae30\ubc18 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub3d9\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2015.32.1.153", "TITLE02": "Combining Ego-centric Network Analysis and Dynamic Citation Network Analysis to Topic Modeling for Characterizing Research Trends", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "153", "LDT": "2017-07-26T17:39:08", "CN": "ART001974026", "ABSTRACT": "The combined approach of using ego-centric network analysis and dynamic citation network analysis for refining the result of LDA-based topic modeling was suggested and examined in this study.

To meet the needs in this area, this paper categorized the digital preservation cost into direct and indirect cost through deriving common elements used in prior research on this issue. For case analysis, two institutions, representing domestic University Library and National Library of Korea under large-scale digitization currently, are selected to analyze the current status of digital preservation and estimate the preservation cost. The case analysis shows the systematic preservation function should be performed to guarantee the long-term access digital material, even though a basic digital preservation is currently conducted. It was projected that the digital preservation cost for the two libraries, accounting for 11.8% and 8.6% of digitization cost, respectively, should be injected every year. However, the estimated figures are very conservative, because the cost for estimating the preservation function, such as installing digital repository and producing meta data, was excluded in the estimation. This proves that digital preservation is a synthetic activity linked directly and indirectly to various activities from production to access of digital object and an essential costs that should be considered from the beginning stage of digitization project.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200503", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "22", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\uc6d0\uc601", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000992564", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:51:59", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080395", "LASTPAGE": "20", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uad6d\ud68c\uae30\ub85d \uc778\ud130\ub137 \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\uc548", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "Improvement Plan for Internet Reference Services of National Assembly Records", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "5", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART000992564", "ABSTRACT": "This study aims at the fundamental factors needed to make the policy for internet reference service of public records were presented, considering the methods for improvement of internet reference service of national assembly records.

First, library site selection criteria were determined through literature study. Hierarchical relationship based on the questionnaire was determined and refined to be suited to Seocho-gu case. A survey was conducted with three groups, namely, library users, librarians, and public worker. A few inconsistent answers to the survey questionnaire were excluded and the relative importance of each criterion was measured. Next, an overlay method was used and the relative importance was used as a weight for selecting candidates. This process excluded the areas where a library was unable to be built, for example, rivers, military areas, other restricted areas by law, etc. and resulted in seventy-five sites. Five groups of candidates were identified according to the similarity of criteria.

For the data gathering I've surveyed 82 students living in Busan, and used the survey sheets to gather data, I made the survey sheet with nominal and interval parts to make the analyzement of data easier. The research result is down below. First, It shows that the students with higher understanding in IT preferred lectures with \u201cPPT\u201ds. Second, The \u201cPPT\u201d preference group thought that the \u201cPPT\u201d teaching method is more effective than other methods. Third, The \u201cWRT\u201d preference group thought that the \u201cWRT\u201d teaching method is more effective than other methods. Forth, Both groups gave each method a 3.08 and 2.95 as a total mean value out on a 1-5 scale showing not much difference. However this research has a research limitation like other researches.

We have analyzed 1,007 IS-research articles from leading Korean journals in KCI (Korea Citation Index), published between 2000 and 2011. To discern the trendline of changes in research interests over time, we conducted a time-series analysis by developing grounded subject scheme from the article set and checking the growth rate of the number of published articles and title keywords. A comparative analysis was also conducted by constructing and comparing co-word maps over time to discover visible changes in research topics over this 12-year period of the IS-research in Korea. As a result, we identified some developments and transformations in major subject areas and knowledge structure of the IS-research in Korea over time. The major trend we discovered is that IS-studies over the 12-year period evolved from system-oriented research to library-application research. The changes are especially observed in knowledge management, Web-based system evaluation, and information retrieval areas. When compared to the results of other studies, the result of our study may serve as an evidence of the localization of Korean IS-studies in the first decade of the 21st century.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201312", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "30", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc7a5\uc724\uae08", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001837524", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:50", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079777", "LASTPAGE": "281", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ucd08\uae30 \uc678\uad6d\uc778 \uc120\uad50\uc0ac \uc790\ub8cc\uc758 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \uc544\uce74\uc774\ube0c \uad6c\ucd95 \ud544\uc694\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c(1800-1910)", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2013.30.4.265", "TITLE02": "The Needs of Digital Archive Development for the Records of Early Foreign Missionaries in Korea (1800-1910)", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "265", "LDT": "2017-07-26T14:22:27", "CN": "ART001837524", "ABSTRACT": "The early history of foreign Protestant missionaries in Korea has begun in the late 19th century, when they came to work as professionals such as teachers, medical doctors, etc. as the nation opened its door to western culture with the fall of national isolationism. Their records are considered crucial resources that enable us to shed new light on modern Korean history, politics, economy and society beyond mere religious value. Despite the recognition of such historic value of early missionary resources, however, there has been serious lacking of a systematic attempt to develop policies and plans for making it easy to collect, preserve and access the resources. Up to date, the records of early Protestant missionaries, in diverse forms of mission reports, books, periodicals, personal diaries, letters and photos, are scattered around various places, including their home country churches, governments, libraries, museums, research institutes and homes. Therefore, this research aims at providing basic resources on the archival status of early Protestant missionaries in Korea, needed for developing a sustainable and systematic digital archive system, through the investigation of early foreign missionaries\u2019 resources and in-depth interviews of experts.

Researchers and practitioners in the field of image indexing have developed a variety of image indexing systems and methods with the consideration of information types delivered by images. Such efforts in developing image indexing systems and methods include Panofsky''''s levels of image indexing and indexing systems adopting different approaches such as thesauri-based approach, classification approach. description element-based approach, and categorization approach. This study investigated users'''' perception of the objectiveness of image indexing, especially the iconographical analysis of image information advocated by Panofsky. One of the best examples of subjectiveness and conditional-dependence of image information is emotion. As a result, this study dealt with visual emotional information. Experiments were conducted in two phases : one was to measure the degree of agreement or disagreement about the emotional content of pictures among forty-eight participants and the other was to examine the inter-rater consistency defined as the degree of users'''' agreement on indexing. The results showed that the experiment participants made fairly subjective interpretation when they were viewing pictures. It was also found that the subjective interpretation made by the participants resulted from the individual differences in terms of their educational or cultural background. The study results emphasize the importance of developing new ways of indexing and/or searching for images, which can alleviate the limitations of access to images due to the subjective interpretation made by different users.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200209", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "19", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\uc900\ud638", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000862006", "ISSUE": "3", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:51:04", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080346", "LASTPAGE": "122", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ub85c\uadf8 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc774\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc6f9 \ubb38\uc11c \uac80\uc0c9 \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\ubc15\uc18c\uc5f0", "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "Investigating Web Search Behavior via Query Log Analysis", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "111", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART000862006", "ABSTRACT": "In order to investigate information seeking behavior of web search users, this study analyzes transaction logs posed by users of NAVER, a major Korean Internet search service.

RDA is new cataloging rules that embody the International Cataloging Principles(2009), FRBR and FRAD. It is a structure of bibliographic control of all kinds of resources, and the rules can be flexibly applicable in the international cataloging community. It is critical to embody RDA in KCR 4 because RDA is likely to affect the future cataloging through its collocation function and relation function to construct semantic web of OPAC.

The corpus is built by choosing categories that hold more than 2,556 documents first, and then 2,556 documents per category are randomly selected. It is further divided into eight subsets of different size of training documents: each set is randomly selected to build training documents ranging from 20 documents (Tr20) to 2,000 documents (Tr2000) per category. The categorization performances of the 8 subsets are compared. The average performance of the eight subsets is 30% in F1 measure which is relatively poor compared to the findings of previous studies. The experimental results suggest that among the eight subsets the Tr100 appears to be the most optimal size for training a kNN classifier.

To verify its usefulness and to obtain users\u2019 suggestions, interviews were conducted and feedback was solicited via collected test searches. The initial set of interviews indicated that physicians\u2019 information needs and search behaviors differed by type of hospital and clinical department. Physicians in university hospitals with a greater need for research materials searched for academic articles, whereas physicians in specialty hospitals or primary care clinics with a stronger need for materials related to clinical practice asked their colleagues for information. Consequently, MediSearching was designed to satisfy both groups\u2019 needs, and the test search provided useful search results compared with existing services.

The main reason for this is because there was no extensive citation index database of domestic journals for analysis. Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) built the Korea Science Citation Database (KSCD), and have provided Korea Science Citation Index (KSCI) and Korea Journal Citation Reports (KJCR) services. In this article, citing behavior of Korean scientists on foreign journals was examined by using KSCD that covers Korean core journals. This research covers (1) analysis of foreign document types cited, (2) analysis of citation counts of foreign journals by subject and the ratio of citing different disciplines, (3) analysis of language and country of foreign documents cited, (4) analysis of publishers of journals and whether or not journals are listed on global citation index services and (5) analysis for current situation of subscribing to foreign electronic journals in Korea.

Among various solutions for issues related to such content, Internet content filtering technologies have been developed for enabling users to deal with harmful content. In recent years, commercial filtering has become massively popular. Many parents, teachers and even governments have chosen commercial filtering software as a feasible technical solution for protecting minors from harmful information on the Internet. The Internet content filtering software market has grown significantly. However, Internet content filtering software has led to intense debate among civil liberties groups. They deem this to be censorship and argue that Internet filtering technologies are simply unworkable because they have inherent weaknesses. They are critical of the fact that most filtering has violated free speech rights and will eventually wipe out minor and controversial, yet innocent incidences of free speech on the Internet. In this article Internet content filtering, in particular PICS/RDF-based label filtering, so-called Internet content rating system, will be explored and its advantages and drawbacks relating to end-users' autonomy and freedom of expression will be discussed.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200709", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "22", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\ubcd1\uae30", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001096267", "ISSUE": "3", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:49:34", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080202", "LASTPAGE": "145", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ub514\uc9c0\ud138\uc790\ub8cc\uc2e4\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc13c\ud130(DLS)\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uac04 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "A Study on the Satisfaction of User Groups of the Digital Library System", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "129", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART001096267", "ABSTRACT": "DLS(Digital Library System) have ben established by Ministry o Resources Development for providing the application services to each school library managers(teacher librarian) and front end users such as student s and teachers.

Three variations of KL-divergence are investigated; Jansen-Shannon divergence, symmetric skew divergence, and minimum skew divergence. In order to verify the contribution of distributional similarities to document clustering, two experiments are designed and carried out on three test collections. In the first experiment the clustering performances of the three divergence measures are compared to that of cosine measure. The result showed that minimum skew divergence outperformed the other divergence measures as well as cosine measure. In the second experiment second-order distributional similarities are calculated with Pearson correlation coefficient from the first-order similarity matrixes. From the result of the second experiment, second-order distributional similarities were found to improve the overall performance of document clustering. These results suggest that minimum skew divergence must be selected as document vector similarity measure when considering both time and accuracy, and second-order similarity is a good choice for considering clustering accuracy only.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200712", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "24", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uae40\ud604\ud76c", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001229785", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:50:15", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080270", "LASTPAGE": "72", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ube44\ub514\uc624 \uc790\ub8cc\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8 \ucd94\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc601\uc0c1 \ucd08\ub85d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc131\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "An Experimental Study on the Effectiveness of Storyboard Surrogates in the Meanings Extraction of Digital Videos", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "53", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART001229785", "ABSTRACT": "This study is designed to assess whether storyboard surrogates are useful enough to be utilized for indexing sources as well as for metadata elements using 12 sample videos and 14 participants.

Conducted as part of a larger study. this study focuses on learning by analyzing students' use of cognitive skills during the process of using information. Within the broad methodological framework of qualitative research in constructivist paradigm (Guba and Lincoln. 1998), the study applied the revised Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2000) as a particular framework to understand the phenomenon. Participants included 21 high school juniors in an honors' class of persuasive speech. The study's combinational use of two techniques concept mapping and individual interview - in a naturalistic setting proved to be the unique methods for researching the reflection of information use in learning products. The results revealed that changes in students' understanding occured in four types - simple, analytic, organizational, and holistic changes. The analysis using the revised Bloom's taxonomy showed that a variety of cognitive skills were used during the whole process of information use and that the use of higher levels of cognitive skills is particularly crucial.

Its interoperability with other kinds of previous ontology and metadata was also considered so that the developed ontology may be applicable to the real situation. The ABC Ontology can get extended into another field where the application of the concept of event is possible, for ABC Ontology provides the fundamental framework on the axis of event. In this study it is Music where ABC Ontology can be applied properly, which results in creating Music Ontology. Music Ontology provides the infrastructure of knowledge for reasoning of potential meaning as well as the simple semantic connection of terms. The extended model of ABC Ontology has been developed by applying Music Ontology, which is the domain ontology and conveys meaning, to ABC Ontology that represents the whole framework. The representation of conceptual relation in ABC Ontology turns into the association of the framework and meaning in the extended model of ABC Ontology, with reasoning rules which are typical in ontology. Also, interoperability of the extended model of ABC Ontology is examined in consideration of co-operating with metadata different from those in it. \ud575\uc2ec\ub418\ub294 \ub9d0: ABC \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0, \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8, \uba54\ud0c0\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc0c1\ud638\uc6b4\uc6a9\uc131, \uc74c\uc545 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0, \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0 \ud1b5\ud569, OWL", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200703", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "24", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\ud64d\uc7ac", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001050103", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:49:49", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080228", "LASTPAGE": "74", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc774 \uc9c0\uc2dd\ucc3d\ucd9c\uacfc \uacf5\uc720 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 - \uc911\uc559\ud589\uc815\uae30\uad00\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\ucc28\uc6a9\uc9c4", "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "An Influence of the Appraisal and Reward on the Activities of Knowledge Creation and Knowledge Sharing - With Focus on the Central Administrative Government", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "55", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART001050103", "ABSTRACT": "The purposes of this study are to examine the influences of appraisal and reward on the activities of knowledge management and to search the strategies for effective appraisal and reward system to activate the knowledge management.

First, the results through the Delphi method that was to adopted to verify evaluation items and indicators determined by the literature review show that the repressed values for each evaluation category is greater than 3.00, overall average is 4.02. and standard deviation is ranged from 0.40 to 0.62 for each category. This means that the evaluation indicators are valid. Second, the factor analysis was performed to verify the construct validity of evaluation indicators. As a result, the cumulative variance of evaluation indicators consisting of 11 dimensions per factor is 72.733%. In turn, this result shows that the validity of these indicators is very reliable. Third, t-test and one-way ANOVA are performed within significance probability 0.05 in order to verify differences in each librarians point of views for the degree of importance in evaluation indicators.

It includes history, tradition, natural features, art, and historic relics. The Academy of Korean Studies has complied \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Korean Local Culture\u201d using those local culture contents. Local culture content shave the features of documentary, such as authenticating the source, and managing hierarchy structure. Thus, to deal with local culture contents, a \u201ccircular knowledge information management system\u201d is sought for that helps basic, fragmentary, and high-level information to circulate to create new knowledge information within the system. A user of this circular knowledge information management system is able not only to collect data directly in it, but also to fetch data from other database. Besides, processing the collected data helps to create new knowledge information. But, it\u2019s very difficult to sustain the features of the original hierarchy bearing meaning contained in the various kinds of local culture contents when building a new database. Moreover, this kind of work needs many times of correction over a long period of time. Therefore, a system in which compilation, correction, and service can be done simultaneously is needed. Therefore, in this study, focusing on the case of \u201cThe Encyclopedia of Korean Local Culture\u201d, I propose a XML-based digital compilation management system that can express hierarchy information and sustain the semantic features of the local culture contents containing lots of ancient documents, and introduce the expanded functions developed to manage contents in the system.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200909", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "33", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ud615\uc740\uc601", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002149214", "ISSUE": "3", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:26", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079741", "LASTPAGE": "106", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uacf5\uacf5\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00 \uc601\uc720\uc544\uc2e4 \uc790\ub8cc\uc870\uc9c1 \uc2e4\ud0dc\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c: J\uc2dc \uc2dc\ub9bd\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00\uc758 \ubc30\uac00\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uae40\uc218\uc815", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2016.33.3.085", "TITLE02": "A Study on Resource Organization in Infants & Young Children\u2019s Sections in Public Libraries: Focusing on the Arrangement of Library Materials in J City's Municipal Libraries", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "85", "LDT": "2017-07-27T09:48:52", "CN": "ART002149214", "ABSTRACT": "With a purpose of investigating the current status of resource organization for infants and young children\u2019s resources, this study examined 8 municipal libraries in J city and suggested recommendations for improvements.

The CIMI consortium exceeded its original mission by; creating a standards framework, profile, testbeds, important metadata publications, free downloadable metadata software and protocols, and providing instrumental guidance and support in development of new projects. However, CIMI\u2019s emphasis on the importance and utility of a standards-based approach and the necessity for implementing the CIMI Standards Framework is probably its most important achievement. During CIMI\u2019s tenure, museums reaped the benefits by learning how to apply the model and standards to meet their individual needs while not having to invent new ones or bear the cost of software development. Although CIMI operations ceased in 2003, its impacts on museum related metadata application and research were unprecedented in that it provided the standards prototype and foundations on which to build.

The recommendations for information literacy education are as follows: objective relevance judgement education, guidance of reliable information source, showing guideline of using reference information by professor and emphasis of engaging in information (4.1 stage of Big 6).", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201403", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "31", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\ubbf8\ud654", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001860206", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:39", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079771", "LASTPAGE": "97", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ubbf8\uad6d \ub300\ud559\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00\uc758 RDA \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2014.31.1.077", "TITLE02": "A Study on the Comparison of Applying RDA in US Academic Libraries", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "77", "LDT": "2017-07-26T15:18:26", "CN": "ART001860206", "ABSTRACT": "It is necessary to find the practical considerations for applying RDA in building up the bibliographic records by importing RDA records from LC or OCLC in Korea. Especially, it is not easy to apply RDA appropriately because there are many alternatives and options in RDA. Therefore, this study is to grasp the way for applying RDA in building up the bibliographic records by reviewing LC RDA guidelines and analyzing RDA cataloging policies of libraries such as University of Chicago, North Carolina State University, and Standford University. As a result, these libraries have catalogued according to LC RDA guidelines and each library has its own guidelines, i.e., in statement of responsibilities, to transcribe all but exceptionally allow to transcribe only first, in publication statement, to use 264 field or 260 field, and in resource types, to transcribe all types of content, media and carrier or to transcribe 33X with GMD. Therefore followings would be considered for RDA application. First, some variations could be allowed for special situations of libraries in applying RDA and LC RDA guidelines. Second, the hybrid records that describe the core element of RDA to non-RDA records would be written in processing AACR2 to RDA. Third, the display of 33X field would be designed for expressing the resource types.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201403", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "33", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ucd5c\uc815\uc6d0", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002116859", "ISSUE": "2", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:30", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079749", "LASTPAGE": "156", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uacf5\uacf5\uae30\ub85d\uad00\uc758 \uc18c\uc15c\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uc774\uc6a9 \ud604\ud669 \ubc0f \uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \uad00\uc2ec\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d: \uad6d\uac00\uae30\ub85d\uc6d0\uacfc \ub300\ud1b5\ub839\uae30\ub85d\uad00\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uac15\uc8fc\uc5f0;\ubc15\uc900\ud615;\uc624\ud6a8\uc815", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2016.33.2.135", "TITLE02": "A Study on Social Media Usage of Government Archival Services and Users\u2019 Interestedness: Focused on \u201cNational Archives of Korea\u201d and \u201cPresidential Archives\u201d", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "135", "LDT": "2017-07-27T09:35:46", "CN": "ART002116859", "ABSTRACT": "Recently, as the importance of user-oriented archives management is becoming increasingly, government archives try to serve interactive services using social network service (SNS) beyond one-way approaches.

This analysis model of applying the empirical research pursues the solutions to provide efficiency. Although many attempts have been made domestically and internationally to study the measurement of the efficiency, mere application of analysis techniques used in the other public sectors has led to the inadequate measurement for characteristics of library services. In addition, there has not been any attempt made to deduce a general theory for the study from the measurement results. In this study, an analysis model that reflects the inherent characteristics in library services is suggested to be analyzed empirically, and this leads to the understanding of efficiency factors. The results of the study show that the efficiency of current public libraries can be increased on the basis of input and output. Therefore the commitment to increase the level of output to meet the current need shall continue by the amount, rather than by the commitment to reduce the level of input. Finally, the factors influencing the efficiency are the number of users, the physical environment, professional staffs, events planning, and electronic resources. After analyzing the five factors via multiple regression analysis, three factors such as the number of users, professional staff and events planning proved causal relationship with the efficiency.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201203", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "29", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ubc15\uc9c0\uc601", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001650945", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:46:11", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079913", "LASTPAGE": "251", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ub9c1\ud06c\ub4dc \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc11c\uc9c0 \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2012.29.1.231", "TITLE02": "Extending Bibliographic Information Using Linked Data", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "231", "LDT": "2017-07-26T11:45:37", "CN": "ART001650945", "ABSTRACT": "In this study, Linked Data was used for extending bibliographic data, because Linked Data provides shareable identifiers, data structures, and link information.

We first investigated whether acoustic features (speaking rate, pitch pattern, and intensity) are equally important and, if not, which one can be effectively modeled to compute the significance of segments for lecture summarization. As a result, we found that the intensity (that is, difference between max DB and min DB) is the most efficient factor for speech summarization. We evaluated the intensity-based method of using the difference between max-DB and min-DB by comparing it to the keyword-based method in terms of which method produces better speech summaries and of how similar weight values assigned to segments by two methods are. Then, we investigated the way to present speech summaries to the viewers.

Besides, synonymous terms with the same concept are usually treated as different features. This study aims to improve text categorization performance by integrating synonyms into a single feature and by replacing input terms not in the training document set with the most similar term occurring in training documents using Wikipedia. For the selection of classification features, experiments were performed in various settings composed of three different conditions: the use of category information of non-training terms, the part of Wikipedia used for measuring term-term similarity, and the type of similarity measures. The categorization performance of a kNN classifier was improved by 0.35~1.85% in F1 value in all the experimental settings when non-learning terms were replaced by the learning term with the highest similarity above the threshold value. Although the improvement ratio is not as high as expected, several semantic as well as structural devices of Wikipedia could be used for selecting more effective classification features.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201206", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "30", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ud604\ubb38\uc218", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001758632", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:45:12", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079821", "LASTPAGE": "178", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uacf5\uacf5 \uc804\uc790\uae30\ub85d\uc758 \uc0dd\uc560\uc8fc\uae30 \uae30\ubc18 \uad00\ub9ac \ube44\uc6a9 \ubaa8\ud615\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2013.30.1.151", "TITLE02": "A Study on Lifecycle Cost Model for Electronic Records & Archival Management", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "151", "LDT": "2017-07-26T14:22:27", "CN": "ART001758632", "ABSTRACT": "This study aims to propose a lifecycle cost model for electronic records & archival management.

However, the JIF contains its critical limitation, in which it does not measure the impact of journal but the average impact of articles in journal. Besides significant number of problems of the JIF has been noticed. Furthermore, given the limited coverage of domestic citation index database in comparison to those of international citation index, it is necessary to apply a more appropriate index with a high level of discriminating power. This study, therefore, aims to introduce some practical methods to measure the impact of domestic journals by using the Hirsch-type indices. As the Hirsch-type indices has been often used for overcoming the limitations of the JIF in worldwide, we hope that our research outcome offers an effective alternative to gauge the impact of journals more accurately. Consequently, using the variations of the h-index(hs-index, fs-index) or the sum of issue level(issue based h-index, issue based f-index), we argue that it would improve the discrimination capacity of the Hirsch-type indices significantly and that we can measure the impact of domestic journals more clearly.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201003", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "27", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uae40\ub3d9\uc219", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001432618", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:47:39", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080019", "LASTPAGE": "60", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc800\uc791\uad00\ub828 \uc694\uc18c\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud3ed\uc18c\ub178\ubbf8 \ud0dc\uadf8\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c: LibraryThing\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c ", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uc815\uc5f0\uacbd", "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "A Study on the Application of LibraryThing Folksonomy Tagsthrough the Analysis of Elements related with Work", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "41", "LDT": "2017-07-26T10:07:04", "CN": "ART001432618", "ABSTRACT": "This study aims to analyze the properties of the tags used in the fiction genre, the structural aspect of the patterns and the contents of the tags by utilizing LibraryThing, where the tags are assigned in work units of FRBR.

As a result, the proposed scientific article recommendation system with TPIPF was proven to be better.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201603", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "33", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc721\uc9c0\ud61c", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002092130", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:03", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079684", "LASTPAGE": "137", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uacf5\uacf5\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00 \uacf5\uac04 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uacf5\uac04 \uc720\ud615 \ubc0f \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uae40\uae30\uc601", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2016.33.1.111", "TITLE02": "A Study on Influence of Spatial Types Based on Public Library Spatial Characteristics", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "111", "LDT": "2017-07-27T09:32:35", "CN": "ART002092130", "ABSTRACT": "The roles of public libraries have been diverse not only provision of information but also provision of cultural programs. According to this trend, the spatial composition of public libraries have been also changed to reflect the diverse roles. This study is conducted to explore the spatial characteristics in public libraries with two objectives: 1) to suggest spatial types in public libraries based on their physical characteristics, and 2) to explore the relationships between the spatial types and users\u2019 perception. To accomplish these objectives, we adopted observation and questionnaire survey as research methods. Consequently, three spatial types of public libraries are identified based on an investigation of several public libraries: divided, partially integrated, and integrated. Then, several statistical analyses, including one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), are conducted with the questionnaire survey data. The results from the statical analyses show that there are significant differences in users\u2019 perceptions and behaviors between the spatial types. That is, the spatial type influences user\u2019s perceptions. This study is meaningful in terms of its first attempt to explore the relationships between spatial factors in libraries and users\u2019 perceptions. Based on this, it is suggested that libraries should consider their spatial structures for developing user\u2019s positive perception on the libraries.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201603", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "33", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\ubbf8\ud654", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002092116", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:04", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079685", "LASTPAGE": "52", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "RDA \uc790\uc6d0\uc720\ud615 \ub514\uc2a4\ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2016.33.1.033", "TITLE02": "A Study on the Display Considerations of RDA Resource Type", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "33", "LDT": "2017-07-27T09:32:35", "CN": "ART002092116", "ABSTRACT": "This study was to find the display considerations of RDA resource type - content type, media type, and carrier type. The Literature review, the case study, and the survey were used as the research method. 5 display strategies were suggested in this study. First, content and carrier types were better displayed than all 3 types of RDA resources. Second, two kinds of algorithm should be considered for RDA resource icon display. One was the combination of the terms of carrier types plus content types icon. The other was the combination of carrier types icon and content types icon in which the terms reflecting types must be included. Third, the subfield of 33x must be used for the paired display of content type and carrier type of multi-types resources. Fourth, in brief display, resource type icon was better positioned on the left and upper side and in detailed display, resource types were better located in description area.

The following data was used for the network and frequency analysis: titles, keywords and affiliation information extracted from the Korean journals serving the LIS fields as well as the conference proceedings of the Korean HCI society. Information communication technology, computer engineering, and technology industry had been active in research collaborations but LIS field was comparatively not active. This study was able to determine that LIS researchers carried out important research but they had not much interests in the topics that required interdisciplinary collaboration.

Key findings include the following: First, in over 80% of member libraries, the number of outgoing requests exceeded the number of their responses to incoming requests. That is, for the vast majority of member libraries, their participation was concentrated on the request side. Second, KERIS DDS relies heavily on a relatively small number of top contributors, especially on the supply side. While the top contributors were active in both requests and responses (supplies), in most cases, they received and processed a disproportionally large number of requests. Third, the network analysis based on DDS requests for journal articles in 2012 further revealed the central role of top contributors.

Findings of this study indicated that there were substantial differences in terms of years of LibQUAL+ survey and user groups with undergraduate/graduate students in three dimensions. In particular, the results of A library showed that users were likely to expect more from the university library, but they perceived low service quality.

The bid deal, started in the mid-1990s, offered a number of advantages for academic libraries and their users. However, escalating prices for these packages have become a serious issue casting doubts about the sustainability of the subscription-based model. At the moment, it appears there is no viable alternative other than pay-per-view method that is being tested at some libraries. Libraries\u2019 budget situation will remain a key factor that might change the situation. Open access started in the 2000s as a vehicle to eliminate barriers to publishing and distributing peer-reviewed scholarly journal articles. Open access publishing is witnessing two-digit growth annually. Open access articles now occupy close to 20% of two major citation databases: Scopus and Web of Science. Google Scholar service, debuted in late 2004, is now a popular tool for discovering and accessing scholarly articles from a vast selection of journals around the world. There is a call for taking Google Scholar seriously as a potential replacement of library databases amid concerns regarding the quality of journals indexed, limited search capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis library databases, and monopoly of public goods. Escalating budget problems, rapid growth of open access publishing and the emergence of powerful free tool, such as Google Scholar, need to be taken seriously as these forces might bring disruptive changes to the existing subscription-based model of scholarly contents at academic libraries", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201212", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "29", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\uc218\uc0c1", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001731497", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:45:21", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079843", "LASTPAGE": "227", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00 R&D \uc815\ucc45\uacfc\uc81c \ubc1c\uad74\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\ub178\uc9c0\ud604", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2012.29.4.209", "TITLE02": "A Preliminary Study on the Development of Library R&D Policy Agenda", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "209", "LDT": "2017-07-26T11:45:37", "CN": "ART001731497", "ABSTRACT": "This study intends to develop R&D policy agendas that are required to prepare a smart library/smart society in Korea libraries.

This study surveyed these library users\u2019 perception of privacy and the effect of the education after providing library user privacy education. As a result, first, it was found that after education, users were more interested in their privacy, rated the problem of library user privacy as more severe, and rated library user data collection as more likely to be considered privacy invasion. Second, we investigated users\u2019 perception of how much user service records being collected in libraries violate users\u2019 privacy, which showed a great perception change in 25 questions after the education.

And compared recognition distance between the elements of materials of individual visitor group with multidimensional scaling and K-mean group analysis. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a technique for projecting the cognitive state in space by evaluating the similarity or attribute of the analysis target. Even though it is mainly used for market diagnosis in marketing, It can also be applied to present an ideal physical layout plan by analyzing the distance. As a result of analysis, the main discoveries are as follows. First, elementary school students cognize child, baby and computer materials should be adjacent as a same group. But recognition of adults(school parents) is reflected by differing from elementary school students vastly. They cognize that computer materials should be formed as a special group separated from child and baby\u2019s materials. Second, elementary school higher graders and adults(school parents) groups also want to separate their main reading materials from baby\u2019s book, therefore They both want to secure silent reading space separating from baby. Third, as a result to confirming how this recognition distance system of materials is reflected in a real children\u2019s library through three children\u2019s libraries in Y-gu, Incheon, there is no library with structure according perfectly with a recognition system of a particular class, but a recognition system of adults and elementary school students is partially reflected because baby, child and computer materials, and baby and child materials are commonly separated and placed. It is difficult to insist that a recognition system of a visitor group, especially a recognition system of children is absolute consideration conditions in material placement of a children\u2019s library. However, understanding cognition of the user groups can be an important evidentiary factors to offer differentiated service space according to visitors and effective placement of the elements of library resources.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201703", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "34", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc2e0\uc740\uc790", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002210482", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T02:35:24", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1350812", "LASTPAGE": "218", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uad6d\ub0b4 \ub300\ud559 \ub9ac\ud3ec\uc9c0\ud130\ub9ac\uc758 \uc138\uacc4\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2017.34.1.197", "TITLE02": "Global Impact of Institutional Repositories in South Korean University", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "197", "LDT": "2017-07-27T10:19:30", "CN": "ART002210482", "ABSTRACT": "This study attempts to measure visibility and impact of university repositories in South Korea with the help of web-sites, OpenDOAR, ROAR and RWR.

While e-Book contains the components regarded as an information system(IS), few studies have been conducted to assess the success of e-Book from IS perspective. This study proposed and empirically evaluated an e-Book success model. Structural equation modeling techniques were applied to the data collected by questionnaire from 241 users of e-Book.

This paper concludes that, first, it is significant that specialist groups do not change their initial responses compared to a general librarian group. Second, there are no differences by survey purpose; however, participants tend to change their initial responses by others\u2019 opinions rather than by previous use experiences. Third, participants who initially answered positively tend not to change their responses, and most participants who answered negatively change their initial responses in a positive direction. Fourth, when there are changes, participants change their initial responses by less than two points, and most of them change by one point.

As a result, we found that the text-based diversity index showed different ranking when compared to the reference-based diversity index. This signifies that those two indices can be utilized complimentarily. It was also confirmed that the characteristics and interconnectedness of the sub-topics dealt with in each journal can be intuitively understood through the topic networks classified by considering both the diversity and cohesion.

Also OA fund made by major universities in North America provides publisher with APCs. On the other hand, it is still in early stages in paying with gold OA requirements from Korean funders and universities. The funders have a \u2018Green\u2019 OA policy, such as upload the article accepted version to their online platform. Although it varies by field, many Korean authors are publishing in international journals. Their articles\u2019 impacts would rise when they are published as gold OA.

As a result, many participants showed low level of organizational commitment because of their hygiene factors, such as payment, incentives, relations with colleagues, and job conditions as well as motivators including characteristics of the work, sense of accomplishment, responsibility, promotion, and self-improvement. The two factors are considered to have direct impacts on their organizational commitment. Also, the research revealed that positive goal perception was related to motivators and, at the same time, hygiene factors. Accordingly, we concluded that librarians\u2019 perception of goals are closely related to both hygiene factors and motivators.

From the results of content analysis, this study found out various features as follows. The major types of language text are research articles and interview texts. The keywords were selected from words which are extracted from text content. To form co-occurrence relation between keywords, there use the co-occurrence count. The constructed networks are multiple-type networks rather than single-type ones. The network analytic tools such as NetMiner, UCINET/NetDraw, NodeXL, Pajek are used.

The results of the fourth round exhibited an average of 4.00 for all measured elements and a minimum validity of .75, rendering the model appropriate for use in quality assessments of library open data. The convergence and stability results provided by the expert panel fell below .50, confirming that there was no need to conduct further surveys in order to establish the validity of the Delphi method. The model's reliability likewise garnered results of .60 and above in all three dimensions. This Model completed with the input of the Delphi panel was put through a verification process in which library open data users such as domestic and international librarians, developers, and open data activists reviewed the model for validity and reliability.

Public transportation applications should be accessible to everyone, and studies should focus on the user\u2019s perspective. However, previous user surveys have concentrated on applications\u2019 technical aspects or visual design. As a result, there has been a lack of general usability evaluations. This study aimed to evaluate the usability of mobile transportation applications in real life, with a focus on public transportation in Seoul.

In particular, the problem of extracting novel geo-names, which are currently obsolete, is difficult to solve because obtaining a corpus used for training dataset is burden. To build a corpus for training data, an admin tool, HTML crawler and parser in Python, crawled geo-names and usages from a vocabulary dictionary for Korean New Novel enough to train a named entity tagger for extracting even novel geo-names not shown up in a training corpus.

It is problematic to interpret a journal\u2019s impact as a single paper\u2019s impact of the journal, so there are several researches to measure a single paper\u2019s impact with its own citation counts. This study applied 8 impact indicators to Korean Citation Index database and examined discipline bias of each indicator. Analyzed indicators are simple citation counts, PageRank, f-value, CCI, c-index, single publication h-index, single publication hs-index, and cl-index. PageRank has the least discipline bias at highly ranked papers and journal bias in a discipline. On the contrary, simple citation counts showed strongly biased results toward a certain discipline or a journal. KCI database provides only simple citation counts. It needs to show PageRank (global indicator) to discover influential papers in diverse areas. Furthermore it needs to consider to provide the best of local indicators.

The emergence of information commons is one of the key changes. Most previous studies on information commons have focused on its conception and role. Whereas, considering information commons as a spatial service, this study aims to examine the influence of information commons on user traffic patterns within the library and perception of the library. As the information commons grew into main library service space and facility, it is necessary to explore what influences information commons have on the behavior and recognition of users. Two methods were used. First, observation method was used to record traffic pattern and user behavior. Second, twenty undergraduates and twelve graduates were interviewed regarding the use and recognition of the information commons and the library. The results of the study show that the traffic patterns were different between undergraduate students and graduate students; the location and structure of facilities influences their movement and behaviors; and the recognition of information commons tends to affect the perception of the entire library. The findings may help librarians improve and plan for library spaces to meet user demands.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201312", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "30", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc2ec\uc6d0\uc2dd", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001786191", "ISSUE": "2", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:44:58", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079794", "LASTPAGE": "268", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "LibQUAL+\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uad6d\ub0b4 \ub300\ud559\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8 \uce21\uc815 \uc0ac\ub840 \uc870\uc0ac", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uc774\uc740\ucca0", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2013.30.2.245", "TITLE02": "Service Quality Assessment of University Libraries in Korea using LibQUAL+: A Case Study", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "245", "LDT": "2017-07-26T14:22:27", "CN": "ART001786191", "ABSTRACT": "The paper describes a case study in which Sungkyunkwan University Library participated in the official ARL(Assoication of Research Libraries) LibQUAL+ evaluation program. LibQUAL+ model is based on the SERVQUAL service quality evaluation model originally developed in the marketing area. It details a number of processes including translation of the LibQUAL+ survey instrument into Korean, selection of study sample and choice of survey versions. In addition, it offers a number of strategies that can be adopted in order to analyze the survey data for various comparisons among different user groups and institutions. LibQUAL+ is more that a survey instrument; it a holistic system for assessing library service quality. Despite criticisms on LibQUAL+, we expect that university libraries in Korean will benefit from participating in the program. It is preferable that a group of libraries form a consortium to participate in the LibQUAL+ program as opposed to individual participation. The consortium can function as a learning community through various workshops and sharing activities, thus elevate the overall evalution efforts in Korean libraries to a higher level.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201306", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "30", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc720\uc18c\uc601", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001809373", "ISSUE": "3", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:45:13", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079824", "LASTPAGE": "296", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud788\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc624\uadf8\ub798\ud504\uc640 SPLC \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c: LED \ubd84\uc57c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2013.30.3.273", "TITLE02": "Exploratory Study of Applying Historiography and SPLC for Developing Information Services: A Case Study of LED Domain", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "273", "LDT": "2017-07-26T14:22:27", "CN": "ART001809373", "ABSTRACT": "The purpose of this study is to examine the data coverage and citation threshold for analyzing SPLC(Search Path Link Count) as a main path of a historiograph of a certain topic in order to provide \u2018core\u2019 papers of global research trends to a researcher affiliated with a local R&D institution. 5 datasets were constructed by retrieving and collecting 2,318 articles on RGB LED on Web of Science published from 1990-2013 and 20,109 articles which cited these original 2,318.

A survey of 251 undergraduate students attempted to address the gaps between what students think they should do and what they actually do with regard to source selection. Characteristics of frequently used sources were analyzed to find out the criteria used for source selection. Friends/family were among the frequently used sources although they were not perceived as useful. Unlike other sources suffering gaps between the perceived usefulness and the use behavior, Web sources were the ones not only perceived most useful but also used most frequently. When the important selection criteria were compared with the characteristic of sources used often, students did not seem to actually use the selection criteria they thought important.

To this end, we collected titles and abstracts of the papers published in four major journals such as Journal of the Korean Society for information Management, Journal of the Korean Society for Library and Information Science, Journal of Korean Library and Information Science Society, and Journal of the Korean BIBLIA Society for library and Information Science during 1970 and 2012. After that, we applied the well-received topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), to the collected data sets. The research findings of the study are as follows: 1) Comparison of the extracted topics by LDA with the subject headings of library and information science shows that there are several distinct sub-research domains strongly tied with the field. Those include library and society in the domain of \u201cintroduction to library and information science,\u201d professionalism, library and information policy in the domain of \u201clibrary system,\u201d library evaluation in the domain of \u201clibrary management,\u201d collection development and management, information service in the domain of \u201clibrary service,\u201d services by library type, user training/information literacy, service evaluation, classification/cataloging/meta-data in the domain of \u201cdocument organization,\u201d bibliometrics/digital libraries/user study/internet/expert system/information retrieval/information system in the domain of \u201cinformation science,\u201d antique documents in the domain of \u201cbibliography,\u201d books/publications in the domain of \u201cpublication,\u201d and archival study. The results indicate that among these sub-domains, information science and library services are two most focused domains. Second, we observe that there is the growing trend in the research topics such as service and evaluation by library type, internet, and meta-data, but the research topics such as book, classification, and cataloging reveal the declining trend.

When these streams converge on a specific time point, a policy window is created so that the issues become policy agenda. At this moment, policy entrepreneurs propose their alternatives, which have been prepared already, and try to pass it through the window.

However, cataloging rules for the statement of responsibility mostly deal with the distinction between the principal role and minor roles. This becomes a problem because the responsibility type itself is more important than the order of the types. For this reason, in this paper I will explore improvements of the description methods of statement of responsibility by organizing the role indicators. Namely, using the role indicators more effectively than the current description methods do, we can collocate the dispersed statements of responsibilities.

First, conventional citation analysis methods yield one-dimensional and sometimes misleading evaluation as a result of not taking into account differences in citation quality, not filtering out citation noise such as self-citations, and not considering non-numeric aspects of citations such as language, culture, and time. Second, the citation database coverage of today is disjoint and incomplete, which can result in conflicting quality assessment outcomes across different data sources. This paper discuss the findings from a citation analysis study that measured the impact of scholarly publications based on the data mined from Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and briefly describes a work-in-progress prototype system called CiteSearch, which is designed to overcome the weaknesses of existing citation analysis methods with a robust citation-based quality assessment approach.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201106", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "28", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ucd5c\uc120\ud76c", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001566900", "ISSUE": "2", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:45:58", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "US", "KCI_ID": "1079893", "LASTPAGE": "115", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "A Study of Citing Patterns of Korean Scientists on Korean Journals", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uae40\ubcd1\uaddc;\uac15\ubb34\uc601;\ub958\ubc94\uc885;\uc774\uc885\uc6b1;\ubc15\uc7ac\uc6d0", "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "A Study of Citing Patterns of Korean Scientists on Korean Journals", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "97", "LDT": "2017-07-26T10:49:48", "CN": "ART001566900", "ABSTRACT": "A large and reliable citation database is necessary to identify and analyze citation behavior of Korean researchers in science and technology. Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) built the Korea Science Citation Database (KSCD), and have provided Korea Science Citation Index (KSCI) and Korea Journal Citation Reports (KJCR) services. In this article, citing behavior of Korean scientists on Korean journals was examined by using the KSCD that covers 459 Korean core journals. This research dealt with (1) statistical numeric information of journals in KSCD, (2) analysis of document types cited, (3) ratio of domestic to international documents cited and ratio of citing different disciplines, (4) analysis on immediacy index, peak time, and half-life of cited documents, and (5) analysis on impact of journals based on KJCR citation indicators. From this research, we could find the immediacy citation rate (average 2.36%), peak-time (average 1.7 years) and half-life (average 5.2 years) of cited journals in Korea. We also found that the average journal self-citation rate is more than 50% in every field.

Simple correlation coefficient analysis, factor analysis, and regression analysis were performed on the paper. Therefore factors such as physical volume, availability, forthcoming issue, age and language explaining 67.64% of total variance were identified. After regression analysis using these factors as independent variables, the results were statistically significant. The results showed physical volumes, the total pages of publication, have an influence upon immediacy indexes obviously, although it is expected that journal reputations may affect immediacy indexes. Generally open access journals had high immediacy indexes.

Research evaluation with assessing multiple aspects of individual research based on the understandings of its purpose and pertinent subject area was revealed as being mostly advised in the declarations, and this recommendation can be regarded as being mostly requested in national research evaluation system.

In this study, I investigate the citer perception of citing motives and bibliographic factors through survey and compared the responses according to the researchers\u2019 characteristics. After extracting the 22 motivations and 21 factors through the literature analysis and configuring a 5-point Likert scale questions, I conducted a survey in the wat of an e-mail attachment. From the SPSS 22.0, the frequency analysis, t-test, and one-way ANOVA were performed on the 354 valid samples. As a result, it is found that supporting is considered the most important citing motive and social connection, self-citation have little influence. In the case of bibliographic factors, the journal\u2019s reputation was recognized the most influential factor and the number of pages and authors was the least.

And we propose SSR, which is a new weighted centrality measure for collaboration networks. Using research collaboration data from three different research domains including architecture, library and information science, and marketing, the above twelve centrality measures are calculated and compared each other.

Surveys were conducted in public and university libraries for these. Also, content analyses were conducted to make sense of copyright problems in libraries.

As a result, the relationship pattern between citation counts and degree centrality in a co-citation network fits a non-linear rather than linear model. Also, the relationship between degree and closeness centrality measures, or that between degree and betweenness centrality measures, can be better explained by non-linear models than by a linear model.

The problem of using unlabeled data is practically important because in many information systems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available. There are two steps in general semi-supervised learning algorithm. First, it trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and classifies the unlabeled documents. Then, it trains a new classifier using all the training documents which were labeled either manually or automatically. We suggested two types of semi-supervised learning algorithm with regards to using document similarity features. The one is one step semi-supervised learning which is using unlabeled documents only to generate document similarity features. And the other is two step semi-supervised learning which is using unlabeled documents as learning examples as well as similarity features. Experimental results, obtained using support vector machines and naive Bayes classifier, show that we can get improved performance with small labeled and large unlabeled documents then the performance of supervised learning which uses labeled-only data. When considering the efficiency of a classifier system, the one step semi-supervised learning algorithm which is suggested in this study could be a good solution for improving classification performance with unlabeled documents.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200703", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "20", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc11d\uc911\ud638", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001003137", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:48:52", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "US", "KCI_ID": "1080110", "LASTPAGE": "210", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc2dd\ubcc4\uccb4\uacc4\uae30\ubc18 \ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ucf58\ud150\uce20 \uc720\ud1b5\uccb4\uc81c \uad6c\ucd95\ubc29\uc548 \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "A Study on the Development of Information Systems for Digital Contents Based on Standard Digital Identifier(SDI)", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "195", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART001003137", "ABSTRACT": "With the rapid development of information technology and internet in these days, resources of knowledge information have been digitalized and distributed on the internet.

In order to identify the most effective method for this purpose, the performance of the three summarization methods were compared. The investigated methods are sentence clustering, passage extraction through spreading activation, and clustering-passage extraction hybrid methods. The effectiveness of each summarizing method was evaluated by two criteria used to measure the accuracy and the redundancy of a summary. The passage extraction method using the sequential bnb search algorithm proved to be most effective in summarizing multiple documents with regard to summarization precision.

Many information retrieval systems rely on the use of a document surrogate. Though they might be surprise to discover it, nearly every information seeker uses an array of document surrogates. Summaries, tables of contents, abstracts, reviews, and MARC recordsthese are all document surrogates. That is, they stand infor a document allowing a user to make some decision regarding it, whether to retrieve a book from the stacks, whether to read an entire article, etc.In this paper another type of document surrogate is investigated using a grouping method of term list.

The 591 valid questionnaire data were gathered from the users acting in forums allowed on the Samsung Economic Research Institute (SERI) (www.seri.org). The empirical results are as follows. First, the SERI intermediary trust and its system trust have positive influence on the SERI forum information quality system quality, and perceived effectiveness.

Calculating these indexes on both artificial data and real data showed that the newly suggested indexes in this article can replace the h-index and its variants.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200609", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "23", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ubb38\uc131\ube48", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001096860", "ISSUE": "3", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:51:15", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080367", "LASTPAGE": "126", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \ucf58\ud150\uce20\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc774\uc6a9\ube48\ub3c4 \uae30\ubc18 \ud558\uc774\ube0c\ub9ac\ub4dc \ucd94\ucc9c\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uae40\uc6a9", "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "A study on hybrid recommendation system based on usage frequency for multimedia contents", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "91", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART001096860", "ABSTRACT": "Recent advancements in information technology and the Internet have caused an explosive increase in the information available and the means to distribute it.

To collect data, a mail survey was conducted during the period of November 2007 through January 2008. Out of 799 humanities scholars sampled from 25 universities, 132 responded with the completion rate of 16%. Major findings in this study are as follows: First, the majority of the humanities scholars distribute their time equally to research and education, and conduct independent research. Second, they still largely depend on print resources, including scholarly journals, books, and manuscripts for getting information, while using some online information resource mostly in text such as electronic documents and journals.

Information center represents an important source which seems very well suited for end-users support investigation. This research explores the end-user support factors that correlate with user satisfaction in information center. To exam user satisfaction, information supporting , service reliability, and system capabilities were identified as potential predictors of end-user support satisfaction at information center. Three hypotheses have been tested with the survey of 252 end-users examines 18 potential end-user support factors such as information supporting, service staff attitude, and system capabilities at information center. Service quality gap between perceived importance and performance for each support factor, is computed. The relationship between these service quality gaps and user satisfaction are tested.

In library community, cataloguing rules for describing information resources such as AACR and KCR have been developed. The efforts to automate management of information resources based on these rules resulted in the development of MARC. However, MARC records are restricted in describing the information resources and MARC has various and distinct characteristics of the structural rigidity, which does not support the representation of extended semantic structures that exist among bibliographic entities. Therefore, since the data model for MARC is single-layer data model, it is not appropriate for describing information resources represented by multi-layer data model which can be used to set up the relationships among various objects in digital libraries. In this paper, we propose an a metadata model for digital libraries based on the IFLA FRBR basic model which supports multi-layer data model and a representation scheme based on XML Schema to manage the metadata about old books, old documents, resource related to music, conferences and seminars.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": null, "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "200412", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "21", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc7a5\uc6b0\uad8c", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000931783", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:50:12", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1080262", "LASTPAGE": "314", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc815\ubcf4\ubb38\ud654 \ucc3d\uc870\uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": null, "TITLE02": "A Study on the Information Cultural and Creating Process", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "295", "LDT": "2017-07-25T18:12:58", "CN": "ART000931783", "ABSTRACT": "Information cultural is the compound of the physical and spirit livelihood mode in the knowledge and information age.

The purpose of this study is to compare the characteristics of co-author credit counting methods by utilizing correlations, multidimensional scaling, and pathfinder networks. To achieve this purpose, this study analyzed a dataset of 2,014 journal articles and 3,892 cited authors from the Journal of the Architectural Institute of Korea: Planning & Design from 2003 to 2008 in the field of Architecture in Korea. In this study, six different methods of crediting co-authors are selected for comparative analyses. These methods are first-author counting (m1), straight full counting (m2), and fractional counting (m3), proportional counting with a total score of 1 (m4), proportional counting with a total score between 1 and 2 (m5), and first-author-weighted fractional counting (m6). As shown in the data analysis, m1 and m2 are found as extreme opposites, since m1 counts only first authors and m2 assigns all co-authors equally with a credit score of 1. With correlation and multidimensional scaling analyses, among five counting methods (from m2 to m6), a group of counting methods including m3, m4, and m5 are found to be relatively similar. When the knowledge structure is visualized with pathfinder network, the knowledge structure networks from different counting methods are differently presented due to the connections of individual links. In addition, the internal validity shows that first-author-weighted fractional counting (m6) might be considered a better method to author clustering. Findings demonstrate that different co-author counting methods influence the network results of knowledge structure and a better counting method is revealed for author clustering.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201406", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "31", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uae40\uc131\ud76c", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001892253", "ISSUE": "2", "EDT": "2018-08-05T01:43:34", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1079639", "LASTPAGE": "97", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\uc778\ud130\ub137 \ud3ec\ud138 \ud559\uc220\uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\ubc15\ud574\uc9c4", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2014.31.2.079", "TITLE02": "A Study on the Quality of Academic Information Service of Internet Portal", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "79", "LDT": "2017-07-26T16:00:42", "CN": "ART001892253", "ABSTRACT": "This study was to evaluate the quality of academic information services provided by Naver Academic Information Service, Google Scholar, and MS Academic Search.

In response to this rapid growth, the demand of automated text processing methods has risen to deal with massive amount of text data. Biomedical text mining discovering hidden biological meanings and treatments from biomedical literatures becomes a pivotal methodology and it helps medical disciplines reduce the time and cost. Many researchers have conducted literature-based discovery studies to generate new hypotheses. However, existing approaches either require intensive manual process of during the procedures or a semi-automatic procedure to find and select biomedical entities.

Thus, this study proposed a novel approach to discover various relationships among source and target concepts and their intermediate concepts by expanding intermediate concepts to multi-levels.

One possible reason is that unfamiliar interfaces of SVWs can be a barrier to novice users\u2019 adaptation of the technology. To understand a role of interfaces in the users\u2019 assimilation of SVWs, we examine an impact of three interface factors (presence, affordance, and feedback) on performance which is regarded as a yardstick for users\u2019 adaptation of SVWs. Forty participants were recruited and went through one-hour experimental sessions with seven tasks in Second Life; they were also asked to answer a questionnaire.

Video as an information service content has become an indispensable element, and it has been used in various ways such as unidirectional delivery through TV, interactive service through the Internet, and audiovisual library borrowing. Especially, in the Internet environment, the information provider tries to reduce the effort and cost for the processing of the provided information in view of the video service through the smart device. In addition, users want to utilize only the desired parts because of the burden on excessive network usage, time and space constraints. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the usability of the video by automatically classifying, summarizing, and indexing similar parts of the contents. In this paper, we propose a method of automatically segmenting the shots that make up videos by analyzing the contents and characteristics of language education videos and indexing the detailed contents information of the linguistic videos by combining visual features. The accuracy of the semantic based shot segmentation is high, and it can be effectively applied to the summary service of language education videos.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201703", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "34", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uae40\uc9c0\ud604", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002210447", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T02:35:25", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1350984", "LASTPAGE": "29", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc778\uc6a9\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uc81c\uc5b8", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uc815\uc740\uacbd;\uc724\uc815\uc6d0;\uc774\uc7ac\uc724", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2017.34.1.007", "TITLE02": "The Current State and Recommendations for Data Citation", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "7", "LDT": "2017-07-27T10:19:30", "CN": "ART002210447", "ABSTRACT": "Data citation remains in its infancy, although providing the citation to a journal article is a typical norm in an academic community.

The results of the study are as follows: Journals making the subject of copyright public had increased from 34% in 2008 to 67% in 2016. Journals transferring copyright from authors remained almost the same, with only a slight increase from 90% to 91% in the same period. Journals using the term \u2018publication rights\u2019 instead of \u2018copyright\u2019 had decreased; on the other hand, journals using the term \u2018reproduction right\u2019 and \u2018right of transmission\u2019 had increased. Use of copyright transfer agreement had increased from 25% to 50%; on the other hand, self archiving policy remained almost the same, decreasing slightly from 13% to 12%.

The model suggested by this study infers research fronts having documents with the potential to be cited multiple times in the future. To this end, the documents are represented by bibliographic, network, and content features. Bibliographic features contain bibliographic information such as the number of authors, the number of institutions to which the authors belong, proceedings, the number of keywords the authors provide, funds, the number of references, the number of pages, and the journal impact factor. Network features include degree centrality, betweenness, and closeness among the document network. Content features include keywords from the title and abstract using keyphrase extraction techniques. The model learns these features of a publication and infers whether the document would be an RF using sum-product algorithm and junction tree algorithm on a factor graph. We experimentally demonstrate that when predicting RFs, the FG predicted more densely connected documents than those predicted by RFs constructed using a traditional bibliometric approach. Our results also indicate that FG-predicted documents exhibit stronger degrees of centrality and betweenness among RFs.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "Y", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201703", "URLFLAG": "Y"}, {"VOLUME": "34", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\ubcc0\uc6b0\uc5f4", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002210450", "ISSUE": "1", "EDT": "2018-08-05T02:35:24", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1350896", "LASTPAGE": "50", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ud559\uad50\ub3c4\uc11c\uad00\uc5c5\ubb34\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(DLS) \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": "\uc774\ubbf8\ud654", "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2017.34.1.031", "TITLE02": "A Study on the Improvement of Digital Library System for School Library", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "31", "LDT": "2017-07-27T10:19:30", "CN": "ART002210450", "ABSTRACT": "This study was to suggest the problems and the improvement plan of Digital Library System (DLS) which has solved the library management and has supported the data building for resource sharing in school libraries since 2001.

The results from the survey indicate that there were significant differences in job satisfaction, satisfaction with human relationship, satisfaction of self-realization, affective commitment, and continuance commitment in terms of the frequency of participation in a book club. Additionally, the number of employees\u2019 reading books and hours spent for reading significantly influenced their job satisfaction and the hours spent for reading significantly influenced affective commitment. It was also found that participation continuity for a book club influenced on satisfaction level of social recognition, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. Job satisfaction level had a complete mediation effect between reading hours and affective commitment, and satisfaction from social recognition had a complete mediation effect between participation continuity in a reading meeting, continuance commitment, and normative commitment. Based on these results, this study suggests a plan for constructing a good environment for employees to read through introducing a reading management as follows.

E-Discovery, derived from Anglo-American law, is the system to find electronic evidences related to lawsuits among scattered electronic data within limited time, to review them as evidences, and to submit them. It is not difficult to find, select, review, and submit evidences within limited time given the reality that the domestic companies do not manage their records even though lots of electronic records are produced everyday. To reduce items to be reviewed and proceed the process efficiently is one of the most important tasks to win a lawsuit. The Predictive Coding is a computer assisted review instrument used in reviewing process of E-Discovery, which is to help companies review their own electronic data using mechanical learning. Predictive Coding is more efficient than the previous computer assister review tools and has a merit to select electronic data related to lawsuit. Through companies\u2019 selection of efficient computer assisted review instrument and continuous records management, it is expected that time and cost for reviewing will be saved. Therefore, in for companies to respond to E-Discovery, it is required to seek the most effective method through introduction of the professional Predictive Coding solution and Business records management with consideration of time and cost.", "ISSN": "10130799", "RSC_EN": "N", "IUD": "U", "PO": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c", "P_YEAR_MONTH": "201612", "URLFLAG": "N"}, {"VOLUME": "33", "DBT2": "KART", "DBT": "NART", "EURLFLAG": null, "AUTHOR_MAIN": "\uc774\uc6a9\uc815", "URL": "https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002184020", "ISSUE": "4", "EDT": "2018-08-05T02:32:46", "ESJ_NM": "Journal of the Korean Society for Information Management", "LANG": "KO", "KCI_ID": "1303606", "LASTPAGE": "26", "FREG_EN": null, "TITLE01": "\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \uac1c\uc778\uac74\uac15\uae30\ub85d(Personal Health Records: PHR) \uc5b4\ud50c\ub9ac\ucf00\uc774\uc158\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9\uc774 \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \uac74\uac15\ud589\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5", "EISSN": null, "AUTHOR_SUB": null, "DOI": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3743/KOSIM.2016.33.4.007", "TITLE02": "The Effects of a Mobile Personal Health Records(PHR) Application on Consumer Health Behavior", "SJ_NM": "\uc815\ubcf4\uad00\ub9ac\ud559\ud68c\uc9c0", "STARTPAGE": "7", "LDT": "2017-07-27T10:05:43", "CN": "ART002184020", "ABSTRACT": "The present study aimed at investigating the strengths and weaknesses of a mobile personal health record (PHR) application and identifying its impacts on consumer health information behavior. For the study, twenty-seven college students used a PHR application for three months, based on which the study conducted paper-based interviews with them. The results of content analysis highlighted the benefits of the PHR such as supporting preventive healthcare and motivating and providing specific guidelines for healthy lifestyles by utilizing visual interface design, sharing the data with family and assisting caregivers to manage patients\u2019 healthcare, and above all enhancing the interaction between patients and healthcare professionals. However, the study found the drawbacks of the PHR such as a lack of data entry for strength training and the incompatibility with other healthcare applications. The participants were motivated to change their health behaviors in ways such as getting rid of sleep disorders, avoiding alcohol and smoking tobacco, and losing weight, and changing eating habits. Some consumers improved self-efficacy by changing their health behaviors, while the PHR provided emotional supports to the consumers who wanted to improve their health. The present study has an academic significance because the study of PHR is a burgeoning area in Korea.

Having a good understanding for academic norms of individual discipline is essential to measure author credit effectively. However, many Korean universities do not consider different norms for determining the order of authors across disciplines. Rather, they tend to use a standardized method to assess the credits of authors in multi-authored papers. Therefore, this study presented some problems of applying a standardized method to measure author credits in multi-authored papers in economics. The findings of this study confirmed the frequent use of alphabetical author order in economics papers; however, many university guidelines for research evaluation do not take account the alphabetical authorship in measuring the credits of authors.
